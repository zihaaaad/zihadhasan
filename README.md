A high-performance codebase powering the personal portfolio of Zihad Hasan. Built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, and **Firebase**.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Static Export Architecture**: Uses `output: 'export'` for blazing fast static hosting on Firebase. Content is pre-rendered at build time.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion.
-   **Security**: Firebase App Check (reCAPTCHA v3) and strict Firestore Rules.
-   **CMS Architecture**: Domain-driven services for managing Blog, Events, Shop, and Users.
-   **Performance**: 100/100 Lighthouse scores via optimized fonts, images, and static generation.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) + [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com)
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion
-   **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
-   **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting

## 🧠 Architecture Highlights

-   **Service-Oriented Core**: Migrated from a monolithic CMS service to domain-specific services (`UserService`, `ProjectService`, etc.) for better separation of concerns and tree-shaking.
-   **Deterministic Security**: Implements `userId_resourceId` pattern for registrations, enabling O(1) security rule lookups without expensive queries.
-   **Cost-Optimized**: Pre-rendered static pages minimize Firestore read costs. CI/CD rebuilds are triggered on content updates.
-   **Facade Pattern**: Maintains backward compatibility via a unified Service Facade, allowing gradual refactoring of legacy pages.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   `pnpm` (Recommended)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Z-root-X/zihadhasan.git
    cd zihadhasan
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and populate it with your Firebase configuration. **Note:** Sensitive keys should never be committed.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key
```

### Running Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## 🚢 Deployment

This project is configured for **Firebase Hosting**.

1.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
    *This generates a static logic export in the `out/` directory.*

2.  Deploy to Firebase:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

## 🔒 Security

-   **App Check**: Configured with reCAPTCHA v3. Ensure your localhost is added to the debug token whitelist or allow-list in Firebase Console for local testing.
-   **Firestore Rules**: Check `firestore.rules` for the robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation.
